# pension_calculator
These are some functions that are used to calculate pension using the Ghanaian social security laws (ACT 766 and PNDCL 247). These computations are based on guidelines provided on the Social Security and National Insurance Trust (SSNIT) website. Developers who want to design pension applications in Ghana and beyond can use some of these functions in their projects.
